// I love creating things. Coding and painting have always been extremely cathartic for me and I'm happy to be leading a life where I can mix creativity and structured logic in my day-to-day as a software developer.

// I grew up in the great, flat, American Midwest and found myself enthralled by the intersections of economics and environmentalism while at the University of Chicago. My first post-grad job involved consulting fortune-100 companies on large-scale technology transformations. I picked up new technologies quickly and transitioned to software engineering.

    <p>
      I am a largely self-taught software developer and business professional, dedicated to finding technological solutions to public problems. I graduated from The University of Chicago in 2016. I then went into management consulting at Accenture, working on large-scale technology transformations for Fortune 100 companies. Today, I'm busy leveling up in blockchain development, contributing to open source projects, and trying to make the world a more amenable place in any small way.

      I love creating, building applications, painting, and am constantly learning new things. My current tools of choice are Javascript, Python, React, Node.js, and the Ethereum stack. Let's get in touch!
