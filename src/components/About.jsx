      <h3>Hi, I'm Evaline.</h3>
      <p>
        I am currently a software engineer at a mission-oriented company in San Francisco. I love analytical and creative work and am dedicated to creating performant, useful, and beautiful products. I have business experience from a past life in management consulting, where I worked on technology transformations for Fortune 100 companies. And I attended The University of Chicago and have a soft spot for all things Chi-town.

        I live in SF with my fianc√©. My favorite activities involve creating things - be it painting, coding, writing, or cooking. I believe in aligning incentives with transformation and that environmental sustainability won't come from deprivation. I believe that 'About Me' sections are hard and barely scratch the surface. Perhaps the most relevant thing to know about me, however, is that I am obsessed with learning new things and am always up for expanding my universe. Let's get in touch!
