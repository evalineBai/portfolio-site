        I am a software developer specializing in web development, interested in finding technological solutions to public problems. I also have business experience, having  graduated from The University of Chicago in 2016 and gone into management consulting at Accenture. At Accenture I worked on large technology transformations for Fortune 100 companies, which gave me an initial appreciation for the ways in which tech is impacting society.

        Today, I'm busy leveling up in blockchain development, contributing to civic open source projects, trying to live sustainably, and exploring beautiful Los Angeles. My favorite activities involve creating things - be it painting, writing, coding, or cooking - and my current tools of choice are Javascript, React, Node.js, and the Ethereum stack. Perhaps the most significant thing to know about me, however, is that I am obsessed with learning new things and am always up for expanding my notions of the universe. Let's get in touch!
