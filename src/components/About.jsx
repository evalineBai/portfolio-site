      <p>
        I am a software developer and business professional, interested in finding technological solutions to public problems. I graduated from The University of Chicago in 2016. I then went into management consulting at Accenture, working on large-scale technology transformations for Fortune 100 companies. Today, I'm busy leveling up in blockchain development, contributing to open source projects, and exploring beautiful Los Angeles.

        I love creating, building applications, painting, and constantly learning new things. My current tools of choice are Javascript, Python, React, Node.js, and the Ethereum stack. Let's get in touch!
