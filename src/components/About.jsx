        I am a software developer specializing in web development, interested in finding technological solutions to public problems. I'm also a business professional, having  graduated from The University of Chicago in 2016 and gone into management consulting at Accenture. At Accenture I worked on large-scale IT transformations for Fortune 100 companies, which gave my a deep appriciation for the ways in which tech is impacting society.

        Today, I'm busy leveling up in blockchain development, contributing to open source projects, and exploring beautiful Los Angeles. My favorite activities all involve creating things - be it painting, writing, coding, or cooking - and my current tools of choice are Javascript, React, Node.js, and the Ethereum stack. Perhaps the most significant thing to know about me, however, is that I am obsessed with learning new things and am always up for expanding my universe. Let's get in touch!
